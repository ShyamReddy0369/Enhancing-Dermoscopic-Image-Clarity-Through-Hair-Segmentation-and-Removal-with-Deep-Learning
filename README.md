Key Features
✅ Image Preprocessing & Enhancement

Noise reduction using Gaussian, Median, and Bilateral filters
Hair removal using segmentation and inpainting
Contrast enhancement for better visibility
✅ Data Augmentation

Random flipping, rotation, scaling, and blurring
Gaussian noise addition and contrast adjustments
Ensures a diverse dataset for deep learning models
✅ Image Quality Assessment

PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) to measure image clarity
SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) to evaluate structure preservation
✅ Visualization & Comparison

Side-by-side visualization of original, augmented, and enhanced images
Helps in analyzing the effectiveness of different filtering techniques
✅ Deep Learning Integration (Future Scope)

Implement CNN-based artifact removal models
Train an image segmentation model for precise hair detection
